You're gonna need python installed to run this program, there are no libraries you need to download though, except, of course pygame if you don't have it.



This was made using pygame 2.0.0




Controls:

A and D to move the spaceship side to side

Space to fire the laser




Notes:

To run the program (at least for me i had to do this), go to the top of the screen where it says 

This PC > Desktop > Space Shooter

or something like that, click there and enter "cmd" and press enter. you can also navigate to the location of the folder with the command prompt, but I think my way is easier.

then inside of the command prompt that appears type in "launcher.py" and then the game runs.


This game was developed by zacc#1312 on discord, join my discord sever (https://discord.gg/tM4fJ8u) to suggest more things/get assistance.

I am not the best coder, this is just a side project that I'm doing to try to get the hang of pygame. Please don't expect the best out of this game.

Thank you for choosing to download this!
